# Learn Gradient Descent with Javascript

This repo is inspired by [A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro)](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning_x/)


I find that learning math behind deep learning through coding and visualization is effective. Even though the course is in python(which is not my primary language), it is still easy enough for me to understand and follow.

I want to test how much I understand the lesson by redo and explain early lesson in the course with my own words and code.

Oh, I also try my best to avoid tensorflow, since it's the advance tool that help us skip the basic. But hey, we are here for the basics!

## Set up and installation

Since this will be javascript project, I decide to use 
`nodejs` to development platform
`mathjs` to mathematic manipulation
`nodeplotlib` to visualize the result (More example on plotly here [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/plotly_js_cheat_sheet.pdf?_ga=2.2676214.711017137.1550402185-1513144731.1549064935))

- `npm install`

## Usage

- `npm run functionPlot`

## Function

[functionPlot](functionPlot.ts)

## Derivatives

## Gradient Descent

## 2D Gradient Descent
